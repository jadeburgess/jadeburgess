### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jadeburgess/jadeburgess** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am an entry-level software developer with a keen interest in front-end development. I recently graduated from Codespace Academy and completed the Software Development course which has equipped me with the necessary skills and ability to learn new software and languages at a swift rate. My proficiencies include HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The ideal job I would like to get in the future is a junior frontend developer. The most basic skills required for this position include HTML, CSS and Javascript, and also include framework and responsive design. I feel like the best way for me to display and demonstrate these skills is by working on more personal projects and uploading these projects to my Github profile regularly to ensure that any potential employers have full access to them if needed.
